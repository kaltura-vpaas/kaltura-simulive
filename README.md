# kaltura-simulive

This is a simple web application showing how a Kaltura VOD entry can be streamed in what appears to be a live setting.

UPDATE: Kaltura now supports simulive natively, see the repo [here](https://github.com/kaltura-vpaas/kaltura-webcaster-simulive-php)!

## Google App Engine

The app is built to run on Google App Engine and can be seen here:

- Simulive on [Universal Studio Player](https://kaltura-simulive.appspot.com/v2.html)
